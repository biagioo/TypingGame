Welcome to The Typing Game!

This App was Built with Ruby on Rails, React and Redux langauges/libraries. 

About:
 Select which difficulty you'd like to play on. 
 
 Easy is 4 letter words, Medium is 5-6 letter words, Hard is 7 letter words. 
 
 You have 5 seconds to write the word displayed, each word you type correctly adds a point to your score.
 
 After the game is over, you'll be asked for a display name for your score to be seen on the score board. 
 
 The score board only shows the top 3 scores for each difficulty.
 
 Feel Free to use the NavBar to Check the scores before playing! Enjoy!

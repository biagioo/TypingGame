Project thoughts:
-the score board shows the 10 highest scores
-if a user beats a score in the top 10 they will be asked for their display name
-a score board for each difficulty 



Difficulties are 
- easy(4 letter words)
- medium(5-6 letter words)
- hard (7 letter words )


Todos:
[] refactor difficulties store
[] refactor ScoreCard component
[] fix duplication issue
[] Post score to backend with display_name once user is finished with Game
[] Populate home page
[] Style
[] CLEAN CODE
